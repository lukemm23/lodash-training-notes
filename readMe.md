# Lodash Training

This is a completed comprehensive lodash training.

# Usage

Each js file includes a commonly used lodash method explained. uncomment the js file inside index.html to run the methods on live server. Study the js file with the method of interest.

- lodash methods to JS methods differences explained
- methods main and shorthand syntax
- exercise / small feature reusable chaining methods

## Section Feature Breakdown

1. Each - creating a new array from mapping object of objects.
2. Map - normalizing back-end data to front-end data format usage.
3. Filter - search by value against array or object with filter/includes.
4. Find - finding the first match from an array or object.
5. Remove - multiple conditions filter / reject.
6. Every & Some - checking if all(Every) or atleast one(Some) meets condition inside array.
7. Sorting - sorting data with multiple parameters
8. Grouping - grouping data by property conditions.
9. Chaining - chaining a sequence of lodash methods and get results.
10. Parting - _.head, _.last, _.tail, _.initial to part arrays and texts.
11. String - letter cases, split, join, and chaining multiple string transformation methods.
12. Randomize - getting random number with from and to arguments.
13. Unique - generating auto incrementing unique IDs.
14. Flatten - easier and more reusable way to flattening arrays.
15. Compact - remove all falsey values from array.
16. Assign - used to merge several objects together without mutating original data set.
17. Clone - use clone and cloneDeep to clone data and edit data.
18. Type Checking - check isNil, isEmpty, isEqual, in lodash as less mistake prone solution.
19. Debounce - use debounce to control event handler running too often.
20. Throttle - forbidding handler to send request too often with set throttle timer.
21. Custom methods with mixins - using mixins to create custom functions to use inside lodash chains.
